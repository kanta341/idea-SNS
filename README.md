# Idea Generator SNS
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
This application is a social networking service (SNS) for generating ideas.  
Users can use AI to brainstorm business ideas or generate responses to daily themes.  
Generated ideas can be posted to the timeline, allowing users to engage with each other.

## Status

This app is currently under development.  
At this stage, only the basic app structure and the timeline feature have been implemented.  
Future updates will include the development of the idea generation component and the addition of more features.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
